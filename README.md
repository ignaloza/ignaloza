### Hi there! Im Ignacio. An argentinian web-developer based in Barcelona, Spain. 👋

-   👨🏽‍💻 I'm a graduate of Latin-American bootcamp Henry in which we learnt different technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB and Material-UI. 
- In this bootcamp I also developed some common apps such as Weather App, IMDB clone, To-Do agenda, Math calculator, Dog finder and a Recipe finder. Our final project was Spa-tify, an app where you can reserve beauty and wellness services to receive them at home. Everything using JavaScript and applying different frameworks. These projects will be available to see in the next few weeks here in my profile :).

- I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding sports⚽🏉🏀, sustainability🌎🌱♻️, tourism🏨🏕️  and music🎸🎧. 

### Why web-development?
  2020 turned my world upside down. I had to close my business for several months and decided to study something that would allow me to continue generating brain movement. Web development was the challenge I needed to get out of my increasingly limited comfort zone. Henry gave me the opportunity, and I'm taking it. In these  months I acquired knowledge that I would never have believed (technical and soft skills), and I have once again a routine (now from my home) that I enjoy. Also, I also have knowledge in digital marketing tools, data analysis, team management and business administration.
